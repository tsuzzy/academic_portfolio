I am a Research Assistant at the Modeling and Analytics in Predictive Systems (**MAPS**) Lab 
in the Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University, 
working with [Dr. Gabriel Spadon](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/Gabriel_Spadon.html) 
and [Dr. Ronald Pelot](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/industrial/faculty-staff/our-faculty1/professors/Ronald-Pelot.html). 
My recent work focuses on marine traffic data engineering, spatio-temporal data analysis, and maintaining the AISdb software.

Prior to joining Dalhousie, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Memorial University of Newfoundland 
under the supervision of [Dr. Amilcar Soares](https://lnu.se/en/staff/amilcar.soares/).
My background in Geoinformatics originates from my B.Eng. in Spatial Information and Digital Technology at Shanghai Ocean University, China.
